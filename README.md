# Virtual-lab-development
# Description
The aim of this project is to develop simulation algorithms that can provide students with a virtual representation of an electrical measuring lab to enhance their learning experiences. This involves creating a web-based platform that allows students to measure electrical quantities such as resistance, capacitance, and inductance of circuit elements through simulations of experiments like the Owen's Bridge,Schering Bridge.

The platform utilizes tools such as the jsPlumb toolkit, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration to enable real-time circuit connections, validate user input, and display results in an observation table. The system also includes logic to generate and identify circuit element IDs, as well as a verification algorithm to ensure accurate circuit connections and measurements.
